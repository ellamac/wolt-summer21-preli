Hi! This is my version of Wolt's Summer 2021 Frontend internship preliminary task. 

I went for a neat and simple design and the site is also responsive. For this small project I decided to use a single CSS stylesheet for minimizing the use of external libraries (instead of utilizing ie. styled-components). For the carousels I did still end up using React Slick (https://react-slick.neostack.com/) and found it to be a simple and straightforward solution. 

For now I believe the current solution meets the assignments requirements but if were to developed this project further, I would refactor some of the components (ie. the cards) into reusable and universal ones, add some tests for all the data handling and implement styled-components for the css-styling. 

I really enjoyed solving this assignment and had fun with the pretty visuals Blurhash creates! Thank you!

This is the first ever preliminary task for a job application process I have done. If possible, it would be really helpful and appreciated to get any feedback of my code and my approach to this assignment. 

Thank you!
Ella Mäkelä
